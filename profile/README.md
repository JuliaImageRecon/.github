## Welcome to the JuliaImageRecon organization

https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon

The goal of this organization is to collect together repos written in the
[Julia language](https://julialang.org/)
that are related to image reconstruction.

Curious about Julia?
Start with
[this shorter article in Nature](http://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-02310-3)
and
[this longer paper in SIAM Review](http://doi.org/10.1137/141000671).

Please contact
[Jeff Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler)
if you'd like to contribute,
e.g., become a member.
Or just start reporting issues and submitting pull requests (PR)s.


## Examples

A good place to start
is with the collection of

## Repos

Each of the following code repos include documentation
that illustrate the Julia code and the output.
[Here is an example](https://juliaimagerecon.github.io/ImagePhantoms.jl/stable/generated/examples/07-shepp).

* [AbstractImageReconstruction.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/AbstractImageReconstruction.jl) Abstract framework for implementing reconstruction algorithms.

* [ImageGeoms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/ImageGeoms.jl) :
  describe image sampling geometry for image reconstruction
  (grid dimensions, pixel size, support mask).

* [ImagePhantoms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/ImagePhantoms.jl) :
  Digital image phantoms (like the Shepp-Logan phantom)
  along with analytical methods for their sinograms and spectra.

* [LinearOperatorCollection.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/LinearOperatorCollection.jl) Collection of linear operators for signal and image processing.

* [Sinograms.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Sinograms.jl) :
  Tomographic image reconstruction.
  FBP for parallel-beam and fan-beam geometries.
  FDK for cone-beam computed-tomography CBCT.
  (Forward and back-projectors for CT are a WIP.)

* [SPECTrecon.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/SPECTrecon.jl)
  forward and back-projectors for SPECT


## About `LinearMapsAA` and `LinearOperators`

This organization has tools that are built either on
[`LinearMapsAA`](https://github.com/JeffFessler/LinearMapsAA.jl)
or
[`LinearOperators`](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/LinearOperators.jl).

There is
[some inter-operability](https://github.com/JeffFessler/LinearMapsAA.jl#inter-operability)
between them.
Submit an issue if further improvements are needed.


## Plans (WIP)

* More iterative reconstruction methods
